    <div>
      No problem. Enter your e-mail address on the <a href="/app/assets/javascripts" target="_blank">TeaCo homepage</a>
      and click on "Create account" - you will receive an e-mail with your access link
      on that address; however, your existing account stays the same - no new one will be created.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">I did register on the homepage, but I didn't receive my access link!</a>
    <div>
      Please make sure the message was not accidently classified as spam by
      your mail program or provider. In addition, mail delivery could take

    <a href="#">What is a "meeting"?</a>
    <div>
      A meeting in TeaCo describes the planning process of a single event.
      A meeting has an initiator and several participants, who suggest
      dates for the event and vote on these dates.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">What is a "restricted meeting"?</a>
    <div>
      The initiator can state at a meeting's creation if all of the
      other participants may only be granted restricted permissions within
      the meeting. In a restricted meeting each participant may only edit
      or delete his or her own suggestions. In addition, only the initiator
      may uninvite participants, pick suggestions as final or change the
      meeting title.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">I'd like to plan my own meeting with some people. What do I have to do?</a>
    <div>
      Click on "New Meeting" in the header bar at the top of the page, provide
      a meeting title and click "OK". To suggest dates, invite participants and
      send the final dates, click "Details".
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Everyone voted. What now?</a>
    <div>
      If you want to finish the planning process, choose one or more final dates and
      mark them as final by clicking them and then clicking the <img src="/images/pick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="pick"/>
      button. Then click on "Send appointment dates" in the detail panel on the right
      in order to e-mail the selected dates to all participants. You can specify a
      message alongside with the dates.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">I cannot uninvite myself! How do I leave a meeting?</a>
    <div>
      Click on "MyTeaCo" in the header bar at the top of the page to get
      to your administration area. You will find a list of all your meetings
      there. Next to each meeting is a link to leave it. Caution: If you
      are the iniatator of the meeting, you will delete the whole meeting
      that way, so none of the participants will have access to it anymore!
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">What does "clone" mean?</a>
    <div>
      If you clone a meeting a new one will be created, where there are no
      suggestions but all participants of the original meeting already invited.
      This comes in handy if you plan meetings with the same people quite often.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">I have other e-mail addresses. Do I have to create an account for each of them?</a>
    <div>
      No, you can use all these addresses within one account. To do that, click
      on "MyTeaCo" in the header bar at the top of the page to get to your
      administration area. You can enter a new address in the section
      "E-mail addresses". Click on "Activate address" to receive an e-mail with
      an activation link in it. Use that link to activate your address. You now
      have all your meetings, no matter which address was invited, in your
      TeaCo account.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">I want to change the e-mail address which I receive my TeaCo messages on.</a>
    <div>
      First, activate the new e-mail address in your account.
      (see „I have other e-mail addresses. Do I have to create an account for each of them?“).
      Now click the blue star
      <img src="/images/make_master_address.png" width="16" height="16" alt="make_master_address"/>
      next to the activated address to make it your main address (you can tell it by the yellow star
      <img src="/images/master_address.png" width="16" height="16" alt="make_master_address"/>).
      All your messages will be sent to that address from now on.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">What is a Free/Busy list?</a>
    <div>
      A Free/Busy list is a file in iCalendar-format which can be generated by
      various calendar applications (e.g. Apple iCal or Microsoft Outlook).
      This file contains information about the times you are not available.
      If you put this file online and provide the URL in TeaCo, these times will
      be displayed as red blocks in your meetings. This tells other participants
      when you don't have time.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Why don't I have to login to TeaCo?</a>
    <div>
      Each user in TeaCo has a unique, 40 characters long key - you can see it
      in the address bar. This key identifies you within TeaCo. So never give
      this key or your TeaCo access link to anyone! Others would have access to
      all your meetings and data.
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
  	<a href="#">How does TeaCo handle different time zones?</a>
	<div>
		A time specification within TeaCo always equates to the current CET 
		(i.e. UTC+1 in winter and UTC+2 in summer), no matter, in which time 
		zone the time specification was made, and no matter, if occasionally 
		the current time was switched from standard time to summer time or the 
		other way round.
